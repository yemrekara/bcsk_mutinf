# Mutual Information Calculations for MCvD (Molecular Communication via Diffusion) using BCSK (Binary Concentration Shift Keying)

This project provides tools for calculating mutual information in the context of Molecular Communication via Diffusion (MCvD) using Binary Concentration Shift Keying (BCSK).

## Overview

Molecular Communication via Diffusion (MCvD) is a communication paradigm where molecules are used to encode, transmit, and receive information. Binary Concentration Shift Keying (BCSK) is a modulation technique used in MCvD where information is encoded in the concentration of molecules.

This project implements mutual information calculations for MCvD using BCSK, based on the work by Genc et al. (2016).
